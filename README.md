##SMART SOLUTION FOR SURPLUS FOOD REDISTRIBUTION.
     #PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION:
     
       How might we innovate to address urban excess food waste, hunger-related deaths, and create a logistic network 
with innovative technology and the cost-effective storage solutions?
     SOLUTION:     
      	Develop a web application to connect surplus food providers with the deficient areas in need of food resources.
      	Reduce urban food waste and alleviate hunger-related issues within the community.
      	Establish a sustainable and cost-effective storage solution for food redistribution.
      	The majority of the food is lost every day in countless restaurants, gatherings, weddings, birthday parties, 
festivals, and other events.
      	There are lots of people who want to contribute food, but they are unsure about how to go about doing so.
      	This project introduces an innovative solution to create a harmonized and efficient food redistribution network.
      Food waste and hunger are two pressing issues that continue to challenge communities worldwide. In urban areas, 
where food waste is particularly prevalent due to various factor such as surplus production, inefficient distribution, 
and consumer behaviour, innovative solutions are needed to bridge the gap between excess food and those in need.
      This paper focuses on creating a web application. There are five roles available in this web application: 
“Donor”, “Volunteers”, “Receivers”, “Food courier”, and “Food Bank”. There are lots of people facing food insecurity 
who lack access to smart phones or internet. So, using our web application, Donors can easily donate surplus food by 
posting information about the food items, image, type of food, quantity, time duration, and preparation time.
     The web application operates by enabling food donors to upload details regarding the food they intend to donate. 
     This request sent to the list of receivers and volunteers. The available receivers and volunteers can be request accepted. 
     We are going to manage the delivery system by food courier person who will collect the food from the donor and distribute 
among the needy people like orphanage, old age homes. The volunteers who wish to help to donate food can join us 
for distribution in near hunger-related persons.
     If the food request is not accepted by any other receivers or volunteers, then the request automatically 
go to the foodbank where the care of food is taken. Safety and Hygiene are maintained in foodbanks.  
So, food wastage or food spoilage cannot occur. It will be a cost-effective storage solution.

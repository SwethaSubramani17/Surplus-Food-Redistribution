            <h1>Delivery Information</h1>
            <p>At Donate Food, we are dedicated to implementing smart solutions for managing surplus food<br>
               and ensuring its efficient delivery to those in need.<br>
               Our delivery process is designed to maximize convenience, minimize waste, and<br>
               prioritize sustainability.
            </p>
            <h1> Efficient Routing:</h1>
            <p>We utilize advanced routing algorithms to optimize delivery routes,<br>
               ensuring that surplus food reaches its destination in the shortest possible time.<br>
               By minimizing travel distances and fuel consumption, we reduce carbon emissions and<br>
               environmental impact.
            </p>
            <h1>Temperature Control:</h1>
            <p>Surplus food often includes perishable items that require proper temperature<br>
               control during transportation.<br>
               Our delivery vehicles are equipped with temperature-controlled compartments<br>
               to preserve the freshness and quality of donated food items.
            </p>
            <h1>Collaboration with Partners:</h1>
            <p>We collaborate closely with food banks, Orphanage and<br>
               other organizations involved in food redistribution.<br>
               Through strategic partnerships, we ensure that surplus food reaches<br>
               a wide network of recipients, including underserved communities.</p>
            <h1>Donation Scheduling:</h1>
            <p>Donors can easily schedule pickups or deliveries through our user-friendly platform.<br>
               Our scheduling system streamlines the donation process, allowing donors to<br> 
               specify quantities, types of food, and preferred pickup times.

            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Welcome to DONATE FOOD, a platform dedicated to reducing food waste and<br>
               fighting hungerin our communities. We believe that every meal matters and<br>
               that surplus food should never go to waste when it can nourish those in need.
            </p>
            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>At DONATE FOOD, our mission is simple: to connect generous donors with individuals and<br>
               organizations in need of surplus food. By leveraging technology and the power of community<br>
               collaboration, we strive to make a positive impact on hunger and food insecurity.
            </p>
            <h1>Our Vision</h1>
            <p>At DONATE FOOD, we envision a world whereno edible food goes to waste and<br>
               where every person has access to nourishing meals. Through our platform,<br> 
               we aim to create a network of generosity and support that transcends geographic<br>
               boundaries and fosters meaningful connections between donors, receivers, volunteers,<br> 
               and food banks.
            </p>
            <h1>How It Works</h1>
            <p>Our process is simple yet effective. Donors post details about surplus food available<br>
               for donation, while receivers and volunteers receive notifications and have the opportunity<br> 
               to accept the food. If unclaimed, the surplus is redirected to the nearest food bank<br> 
               for distribution, ensuring that no donation goes to waste.
            </p>
            <h1>Join Our Movement</h1>
            <p>Whether you're a business with excess inventory, an individual passionate about helping others,<br>
               or a volunteer looking to make a difference, there's a place for you in the DONATE FOOD<br>
               community. Together, we can turn surplus into sustenance and make a positive impact on hunger<br>
               in our communities.
            </p>
            <h1>Share Your Voice</h1>
            <p>Your feedback is invaluable to us as we strive to improve and expand our services.<br>
               We welcome your ideas, suggestions, and stories of impact as we work together to build <br>
